# Fortran_Temperature_Conversion
Fortran code for converting temperature in degree celsius to degree Kelvin and saving the output to a new file.
In order to run this code successfully, make sure to save both .f9s and both .csv files in the same diretory.
To compile, make sure you have a fortran compiler such as gfortran installed, change directory in your terminal or bash to the location of both files and run the command, gfortran -o temp_conv.exe temp_conv.f95   
This should compile with no errors. the output of the code should be shown in the terminal and a file named Air-Temperature-Conversion.csv should be created in that directory.
